# How to Create an Example for the DataStax Examples Platform
## Introduction
Beyond the official documentation, there are endless possibilities for combining tools, platforms, languages and products to build really powerful and amazing things on top of Apache Cassandra and DataStax products. Ultimately, everything we build is a unique combination of these elements, but most projects share pieces in common. By submitting an example, you can share your experience and help others who are solving similar problems.

Examples can be short code snippets, complete end to end workflow projects, custom tools for a given task, DataStax Studio notebooks, or anything in between. 

**To submit an idea for a new example:** [fill out the form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmYWbEo0Bh65wwgjhIpnXyODWfX3e99LmJYzTfkVLBVC96oQ/viewform)

## What Makes a Good Example

A good submission is a well thought out example of a particular piece of functionality.  Just as when you design or build an application, designing your example ahead of time helps focus your work on providing the content needed to enable the reader.  Before you begin work on an example think about the following questions:

1) In one sentence, what is it that the example demonstrates?  This can be reused as the first line in the README and at the time of submission as the description for the submission.
2) What does my reader need to know before they can begin?  This is your pre-requisites.
3) What assumptions have I made about my audience?  These need to be stated at the beginning.
4) Why does the reader care about this example? This is important information to include in the introductory paragraph.
5) How can I introduce concepts and ideas in a way that goes from the general concept to the specifics?
6) Is there anything missing from the content?  Is there anything unnecessary to the content?

Properly planning an example will save a large amount of your time during the submission and review process so we highly encourage it.

## Submitting an Example

All DataStax examples are hosted on the DataStax Examples GitHub repository where they can be accessed, reviewed, and updated by any community member with access.

#### To create an example from scratch:

   1. Create a new repository in the [DataStax Examples repo](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples) by clicking on the New Button.
   2. You can then choose to create an empty repo or clone the `datastax-examples-template` repo (recommended) which has all the basic files required.
   3. You can then clone this repository locally using `git clone https://<INSERT REPOSITORY PATH>`
   4. Read the [Style Guide](./docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md)
   5. Prepare your submission according to the style guide
   6. Ensure that your project has all the requirements needed to be accepted according to the [Requirements](./docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) guide.
   7. Submit it here https://forms.gle/iqxydtgSKjBrL1Z86
   8. After you have submitted your example you will be contacted by a designated representative which will help guide your submission through the [Review Process](./docs/REVIEW_PROCESS.md).
   9. After the submission has been approved it will be published.

#### To create an example from an existing repo where you want to copy the whole repository:

   1. If the example is the entire repository then fork this repository into the [DataStax Examples repo](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples) by clicking on the fork and then selecting DataStax-Examples from the drop down.
   3. You can then choose to create an empty repo or clone the `datastax-examples-template` repo (recommended) which has all the basic files required.
   4. You can then clone this repository locally using `git clone https://<INSERT REPOSITORY PATH>`
   5. Read the [Style Guide](./docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md)
   6. Prepare your submission according to the style guide
   7. Ensure that your project has all the requirements needed to be accepted according to the [Requirements](./docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) guide.
   8. Submit it here https://forms.gle/iqxydtgSKjBrL1Z86
   9. After you have submitted your example you will be contacted by a designated representative which will help guide your submission through the [Review Process](./docs/REVIEW_PROCESS.md).
   10. After the submission has been approved it will be published.

#### To create an example from an existing repo where you want to copy a portion of the repository:

   1. Create a new repository in the [DataStax Examples repo](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples) by clicking on the New Button.
   2. You can then choose to create an empty repo or clone the `datastax-examples-template` repo (recommended) which has all the basic files required.
   3. You can then clone this forked repository locally using `git clone https://<INSERT REPOSITORY PATH>`
   4. Copy the files from the original repository into the new repository
   5. Read the [Style Guide](./docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md)
   6. Prepare your submission according to the style guide

   10. After the submission has been approved it will be published.

#### To update an example:

All DataStax examples are updated based on a pull requests.  Email examples@datastax.com with the example being updated, the PR number, and a brief description of the changes.  A reviewer will then be assigned to review your change and merge it into the `master` branch.
