# How to Create an Example for the DataStax Examples Platform
## Introduction
Beyond the official documentation there are endless possibilities for combining tools, platforms, languages and products to build really powerful and amazing products on top of the DataStax suite of products. Ultimately, everything we build is a unique combination of these elements, but most projects share pieces in common so by submitting and example you can share your experience and help others who are solving similar problems.

Examples can be short code snippets or complete end to end workflow projects.  In every case they provide context for using one or more of the DataStax Suite of products in the real world and show how to solve a particular problem not discussed in the official documentation.
